# darkOverlay
A quick and simple dark overlay since Itunes 12.9.5 on Windows 10 does not have a dark mode, this overlay makes it easier on the eyes (and of course, this is just a simple "always on top" window so it works with any application) but since it is a quick & dirty solution you can not click through and have to move/minimize it to click below it.
